## Hi there 👋

# Echo Classification using Unsupervised Learning

In this notebook, we classify radar echoes into:
- Leads
- Sea Ice

We use KMeans clustering (unsupervised learning) to group echoes
based on waveform shape.

We then:
- Compute the average echo shape for each class
- Compute standard deviation
- Compare results with ESA official classification using a confusion matrix
